# cytoExplorerExcerpt
An excerpt from my Summer 2015 REU project with the BU Bioinformatics Department (BRITE REU).
My project was to extract patterns from protein sequence data from the OFOR enzyme family. I was given an existing version of cytoExplorer, written by Daniel Bak (2013) and Phillip Steindel (2014) of the Boston University Chemisty Department, and asked to update the software for my purposes.

The code I want to showcase in this example is in organizeHMMSearch.py and organizejackhmmer.py.
databaseMethods.py and jackhmmerparse.py are called in the other two functions, thus I included them for reference.
sampleHMMEROutput.txt is a text file showing the information and formatting which results from running the HMMER program modules on a set of protein sequence data.
